# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m lmf_server
```

## API Test
and please execute the files in the api_test folder for testing API of LMF services including the new service (i.e., Relative Location Service)

For testing the LMF service APIs defined in TS29572, execute the follwing from the root directory after runinging the LMF server
```
./api_test/nlmf_loc_determine_location.sh
./api_test/nlmf_loc_cancel_location.sh
./api_test/nlmf_broadcast_request_ciphering_key_data.sh
```


For testing the proposed LMF service API, execute the follwing from the root directory after runinging the LMF server
```
./api_test/nlmf_newservice_relative_location.sh
```
